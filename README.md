# FristSmartContract

Hello people, these are the first two Smart Contracts that i created after learning Solidity and getting into Web 3.0.

### SimpleStorage.sol

In this file, I have just created a uint256 variable called "favouriteNumber" to store a number as input from the User
&
A structure named People t0 store the name of User and their inserted number.

The addPerson function helps to take input for the above.

There is also a mapped variable "nameToFavouriteNumber", that stores the inserted number corresponding to the name of the user.

### ExtraStorage.sol

This file inherits the SimpleStorage.sol and the only change it does is by incrementing the stored number of the user by 5.



Again, very simple two programs/Smart Contracts. nothing special.

## Happy Coding
